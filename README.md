# DIY Gamer Kit Arduino Library
# Please note, the DIY Gamer Kit was a product made by the STEAM toy company Tech Will Save Us. It is no longer trading, but the product still works fine :-) 

The library is essential for using your DIY Gamer Kit to:

- Draw graphics on the screen
- Make animations
- Code apps and games
- Play sounds on the buzzer
- Scroll text across the screen

## Installation

1. Install the latest version of **Arduino**. You can get this software [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

2. Open the Arduino software on your computer and navigate to **Sketch** → **Include Library** → **Manage Libraries...**

3. Type `Gamer` into the search bar. Two libraries should appear: **Gamer** and **GamerIR**.

4. Click on each library to highlight it and click the **Install** button. Do this for both libraries!

### Testing Your Installation

The easiest way to test that the library has been successfully installed, is to follow these steps:

1. Go to **File &#8594; Examples &#8594; Gamer** and choose one of the example programs (e.g., **SnakeGame**)

2. Click on the **Verify** button to compile the example, and if it compiles correctly (it should say "Done compiling"), you're good to go!

## Contributions and Bug Fixes
